allmyles-sdk-php
================

## Brief

A PHP package aiming to simplify integration of the
[Allmyles API](http://allmyles.com) into PHP projects. The SDK is designed to be
as forgiving as possible, often accepting multiple types as input, handling
conversion between different (at least somewhat sensible) types automatically.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3 or newer

## Usage

See the [Allmyles Docs](http://docs.allmyles.com) for general notes about the
API, and see the
[Allmyles PHP SDK chapter](http://docs.allmyles.com/en/latest/php-sdk.html) for
information specific to this SDK.
